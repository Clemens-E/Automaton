This Project is not intended to be self hosted.
It's main feature is to create messages where people can react with emojis and get a specific role.
The reactions and it's roles are easy to manage and all stored in a local SQLite Database.
This Bot is not public, but when it is it should replace the current Bot with 250 Guilds.
