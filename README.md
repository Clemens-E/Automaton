This Project is not intended to be self hosted.
It's main feature is to create messages where people can react with emojis and get a specific role.
The reactions and it's roles are easy to manage and all stored in a local SQLite Database.
More features will come with the time. Like antispam, Channel Highlight (so you can mark messages with specific content)
This Bot is not public, but when it is it should replace the current Bot with 282 Guilds.
